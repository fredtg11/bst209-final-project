   # Introduction
   
   This is my final project for BST209: Machine Learning in Healthcare.
   
   ## Data Analysis
   
   ```{r, eval=FALSE}
   # Your R code goes here
   library(tidyverse)
   
   # Load data
   data <- read.csv("your_data.csv")
   
   # Basic summary
   summary(data)
   ```

### Key R Markdown Features

- **Headers:** Use `#` for different levels
- **Code chunks:** Use backticks `` for R code
- **Lists:** Use `-` or `*` for bullet points
- **Bold:** Use `**text**`
- **Italic:** Use `*text*`

### Knitting Your Document

1. **Click the "Knit" button** in RStudio
2. **Choose output format** (HTML, PDF, Word)
3. **Your document will be rendered** with code output and formatting


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
